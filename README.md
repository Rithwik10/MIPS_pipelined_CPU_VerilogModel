# MIPS_pipelined_CPU_VerilogModel
A multi-cycle pipelined processor capable of performing basic ALU and branch instructions. The design incorporates a hazard detection unit to tackle the possible data and control hazards. Verilog is used as the HDL to define the RTL modules. Block design and testbench simulations are done in Xilinx Vivado.
Vivado 2020.2 or above is required to open the files.
